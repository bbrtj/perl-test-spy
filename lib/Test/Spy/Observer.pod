=head1 NAME

Test::Spy::Observer - method observer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	$spy->set_base($base_object);
	my $method = $spy->add_observer('method_name');

	ok !$method->was_called;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class objects let you examine call data of a specific method without
actually replacing its behavior.

Observer is similar to L<Test::Spy::Method>, but it does not actually mock what
the method is doing, only attaches itself to what already exists. For this
reason, it makes sense to use it together with L<Test::Spy/base>.

=head2 Call history methods

These methods are the same as documented in L<Test::Spy/Call history methods>,
but when called on this class objects, you don't need to setup
L<Test::Spy/context>.
